# .NET on tiny IoT Meadow Boards

All the files and projects from my talk at NDC London 2022 about using C# on Meadow IoT boards.  

## Getting Meadow Boards

You can get the Meadow boards I used direct from Wilderness Labs:

Store - [https://store.wildernesslabs.co](https://store.wildernesslabs.co/)

Docs - [http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Getting_Started/](http://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Getting_Started/)

for setting up your new board the instructions on the Getting started sometimes cause issues so use this blog post instead as it's the most stable way to set-up a new board.

## Robot Arm

The robot are files can be used to print your very own to move around this is best printed in PLA and you just need SG90 servo's like these - [SG90 Servo](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ARCELI-Airplane-Accessories-Arduino-Helicopter/dp/B07MY2Y253/ref=sr_1_5?crid=18GVRGA7DRGY8&keywords=sg90&qid=1652171728&sprefix=sg90%2Caps%2C97&sr=8-5)

    The Robot arm design is a simplified version of this project from Thingyverse to enable quicker and simpler print and build - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1684471

If you want to know how to build the Robot arm to my son shows how it's done here on YouTube - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk84dhThmjY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk84dhThmjY)

# Set-up Azure IoT Hub

As the end of my talk was rudely interrupted by the Police, fire alarms and car bombs you would have missed how to set-up an Azure IoT Hub.

The docs are here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/?WT.mc_id=IoT-MVP-5003764](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/?WT.mc_id=IoT-MVP-5003764)

and I have a blog post here that explains it for the ESP32 and NanoFramework but the process is very similar - [https://www.cliffordagius.co.uk/post/connectesp32toiothub/](https://www.cliffordagius.co.uk/post/connectesp32toiothub/)
